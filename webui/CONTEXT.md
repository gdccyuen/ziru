# Ziru WebUI Domain Context

This file names the product concepts used by the Ziru WebUI codebase. Use these
terms when naming modules, tests, and route workflows.

## Workspace

A Workspace is the WebUI-owned tenant container that binds one user to one
document domain: it stores local source metadata, chat threads, and the pair
`(ziruKeyLabel, namespace)` — the configured API key (domain) that
authenticates Ziru API access, and the Ziru namespace under that domain
whose documents the workspace's sources live in. One workspace per
(user, keyLabel, namespace) tuple. The active workspace is selected by the
`ziru-ws` cookie (falls back to the user's first workspace, then a legacy
`ziru-<uuid>` default). Legacy rows with a null key label use the default
key and keep working unchanged.

## Ziru Key Label

A Ziru Key Label identifies one configured Ziru API key (a "domain").
Since Phase 3, keys are managed per workspace through the "API keys…" dialog:
stored AES-256-GCM encrypted in the `ziru_api_keys` table and decrypted
on demand by `ensureApiKeyForWorkspace`. `workspaces.active_ziru_api_key_id`
selects the active key. The `config/ziru-keys.json` file (or
`ZIRU_API_KEY` env as a single `"default"` key) remains as a bootstrap
fallback for fresh deployments. The API never exposes full keys to the
browser — only masked labels (`sk_8aB••••GVB8`).

## Workspace Shell

The Workspace Shell is the client-side orchestrator for the WebUI work
surface. It composes Source selection, Parsed Chunk pagination, Chat Thread
state, Citation focus, and panel layout into the visible two-panel layout
(sources | chat) with a full-screen chunks overlay.

## Workspace Shell Layout

The Workspace Shell Layout is the render-only module for desktop and mobile
workspace panels. It receives already-derived state and callbacks from the
Workspace Shell and should not own route calls, SWR keys, or workflow state.

## Workspace Client

The Workspace Client is the browser-side adapter for WebUI route calls and
SWR keys. UI modules should depend on this adapter instead of constructing
route paths or mutation request shapes inline.

## Workspace Desktop Panels

Workspace Desktop Panels is the hook that owns browser measurements and resize
drag state for the two desktop panels (sources | chat). Pure resize math stays
in Workspace Shell State.

## Workspace Resize Handle Workflow

Workspace Resize Handle Workflow owns desktop resize-handle pointer lifecycle:
starting drag gestures, tracking pointermove deltas, and cleaning up window
listeners on pointerup.

## Workspace Selected Chunks

Workspace Selected Chunks is the hook that owns selected Source chunk paging,
prefetched Citation Focus chunks, and "load more" state. The Workspace Shell
uses it as derived workflow state instead of owning SWRInfinite details inline.

## Source

A Source is a document visible in the WebUI sources panel. The WebUI persists
source metadata locally, while parsed content and retrieval live in the Ziru API.
Sources are soft-deleted with `deletedAt` rather than removed.

## Source Repository

The Source Repository is a stable facade over smaller persistence modules. It
composes Source row lifecycle and Source Parse Result artifact metadata
without exposing those internal modules to route services.

## Source Library Localization

Source Library Localization is the workflow that turns Ziru API-owned library
documents into WebUI Source rows for a Workspace. Listing and SSR eagerly
localize compatible-namespace documents (via `localizeRemoteLibrarySources`)
before chunks, archive, selection, or retrieval flows act on them. Only
genuinely new documents are upserted — existing DB rows are pre-filtered to
avoid redundant writes.

## Source Upload

A Source Upload is the workflow that turns either a browser `File` or a
Vercel Blob staged object into a Ziru parsing job plus local source row.
Large files should use the Blob-backed path instead of a Server Action upload.

## Source Upload Contract

The Source Upload Contract names the repository and Ziru API client shapes used
by upload workflows. Persistence adapters can depend on the contract without
importing the user-upload workflow implementation.

## Source Row

A Source Row is the sidebar item for one Source. It owns include/exclude,
selection, status display, and local archive affordances for that one Source.

## Source Upload Dialog

The Source Upload Dialog is the upload UI for authenticated users. It renders
the upload controls and delegates file selection, drag-and-drop selection,
submission state, and upload errors to the Source Upload Dialog Workflow.

## Source Upload Dialog Workflow

Source Upload Dialog Workflow owns browser upload dialog behavior: open state,
selected file state, drag-and-drop selection, upload submission, friendly error
messages, duplicate-submit prevention, and post-upload cleanup.

## Source Original Preview

Source Original Preview is the browser-side read-only view for a Source's
original file. Its model owns file classification, preview limits, download URL
rules, and PDF sizing math; request helpers own file reads so the component
can stay focused on rendering.

## Source Original PDF Workflow

Source Original PDF Workflow owns browser PDF preview behavior: loading the
`react-pdf` module, setting the PDF worker, measuring page width, loading page
aspect ratios, and tracking visible pages for lazy rendering.

## Source Original DOCX Workflow

Source Original DOCX Workflow owns browser DOCX preview behavior: loading the
source bytes, importing the DOCX renderer, falling back to Mammoth HTML
conversion, sanitizing rendered output, and cleaning up in-flight work.

## Source Original Text Workflow

Source Original Text Workflow owns browser text and Markdown preview behavior:
loading source text, tracking URL-scoped load state, and cleaning up in-flight
text requests.

## Parsed Chunk

A Parsed Chunk is a document chunk returned by the Ziru document chunks
API. Parsed chunks can have parser chunk IDs, asset paths, page numbers,
summary, keywords, and connection metadata. Table chunks have their HTML
fetched server-side from `assetUrl` and set as `content` (via
`enrichChunksWithAssetUrls`) because the Ziru list endpoint puts a
summary string in `content`, not the table HTML.

## Parsed Chunk Card

A Parsed Chunk Card renders one Parsed Chunk. It owns chunk source metadata,
content rendering, summaries, keywords, artifact references, and sanitized
table HTML for that card only.

## Chat Thread

A Chat Thread is a persisted WebUI conversation within one Workspace. Chat
threads are soft-deleted without deleting their messages.

## Chat Panel Workflow

Chat Panel Workflow owns browser chat panel behavior: chat history sheet open
state, new-chat actions, delete confirmation state, and archive confirmation
callbacks.

## Chat Repository

The Chat Repository is a stable facade over Chat Thread lifecycle, Chat Message
persistence, and Citation persistence normalization.

## Chat Message

A Chat Message is a persisted user or assistant message in a Chat Thread.
Assistant messages can store citation metadata, but should not persist full
source chunk text.

## Chat Message List Workflow

Chat Message List Workflow owns browser message-list behavior: virtual row
counts, thinking-progress row placement, viewport measurement, and automatic
scrolling to the latest row.

## Citation

A Citation is the metadata that connects an assistant answer to a retrieval
result. Fresh answers can include chunk content for focusing the UI; persisted
history stores only citation metadata.

## Citation Focus

Citation Focus is the workflow that maps a Citation back to a Source and Parsed
Chunk, optionally loading all chunks for that Source when paged chunks are not
enough to focus the answer evidence.

## Retrieval Query

A Retrieval Query is the text sent to Ziru retrieval. It can be generated
from the latest user question plus recent chat context so Ziru receives a
self-contained query. Retrieval runs with `useAgentic: true`, `rerank: true`,
and `internalRecallK: 30` so the LLM reranker compensates for BM25 keyword
ranking. The harness system prompt teaches the agent to craft BM25-friendly
queries: distinctive keywords, query expansion with synonyms/domain terms, and
multiple focused `retrieve` calls for multi-part or ambiguous questions.

## Retrieval Overrides

Retrieval Overrides are optional per-request tuning values that the chat
composer sends in the chat request body as `retrievalParams`: the `rerank`
switch and the `internalRecallK` / `topK` sliders. Each present field replaces
the equivalent hardcoded default — or, for `topK`, the harness-chosen per-query
value — inside `buildRetrievalQueryParams`. The request schema validates and
clamps them server-side.

## Retrieval Trace

A Retrieval Trace is the transient record of every Retrieval Query issued while
answering one user question: query text, namespace, hit count, cited chunk
count, and top scores. It is attached to a fresh assistant Chat Message view
and rendered by `ChatRetrievalTrace` under the sources section, but it is never
persisted to the Chat Message row — reloading the thread drops it.

## Prompt Template

A Prompt Template is a canned `{ id, title, prompt }` analysis prompt offered
by the composer's wand-icon Templates menu. Templates are loaded at runtime
from `public/data/chat-prompt-templates.json` by `usePromptTemplates`, so
self-hosted deployments can override them by bind-mounting their own JSON into
the container without a rebuild.

## WebUI Auth

WebUI Auth is the WebUI's own identity system (ADR 0010). A `User` is a
row in the `users` table; login credentials attach via `AccountLink` rows
(one per provider, `password_hash` for the "password" provider). A `Session`
is a DB row whose id rides the `ziru-session` cookie (HttpOnly, 30-day
TTL); `getCurrentUser` joins sessions × users on every request. Users are
admin-provisioned (no public signup); login is the local `/login` Server
Action and logout deletes the session row. `ZIRU_API_KEY` /
`ZIRU_KEYS_FILE` still short-circuit to the development user as a
bootstrap.

## Ziru Credential

A Ziru Credential is the API key used to call the Ziru API. It is resolved
per workspace by `ensureApiKeyForWorkspace`
(`src/integrations/ziru-credentials.ts`): the workspace's
`ziruKeyLabel` picks a key from `config/ziru-keys.json` (falling
back to `ZIRU_API_KEY` env). The Dashboard JWT path was removed in the
Phase 2 hard-cut — the WebUI never requests or stores Dashboard tokens.

## Route Service

A Route Service is a domain module that owns route workflow behavior and
returns route-ready data. Next.js route handlers should stay thin HTTP
adapters: parse HTTP primitives, call a Route Service, and serialize the
result.

## Route Context

Route Context is the small request-scoped adapter passed from Next.js route
handlers into Route Services. It contains HTTP-derived values such as the
incoming cookie header and keeps those primitives out of domain workflow code.
