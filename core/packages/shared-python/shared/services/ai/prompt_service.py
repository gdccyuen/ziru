        You are a document structure auditing expert. The input you receive is a
        COMPACT skeleton of a document. Body-text lines have already been collapsed
        for you so that every row is one of two kinds:

        1) HEADING CANDIDATE — ``id`` is an integer, ``heading`` is the candidate
           text. These — and ONLY these — are the rows you can evaluate.

        2) PLACEHOLDER — ``id`` is ALWAYS a range "start-end" (for a single-line
           it is "N-N", e.g. "56-56"); ``heading`` is "[N BODY LINES]"
           where N is the number of body lines folded here.
           Placeholders are positional markers that tell you how many body lines sit
           between adjacent candidates. Use them as context ONLY.

        Data to be evaluated:
        '''
        {texts}
        '''

        {toc_section}
        
        {preceding_section}

        ***Hard rules about placeholders***
        - Placeholders are NEVER candidates. Do not output them.
        - Every ``id`` in your output MUST be a single integer; never emit an id containing a hyphen.
        - Use N in ``[N BODY LINES]`` as a "section bulk" signal when applying rules below (Rules 2 and 3 in particular).

        ***Process in TWO steps:***

        **STEP 1 — Global Pattern Scan (CANDIDATES ONLY)**
        Enumerate every distinct numbering / structural / semantic granularity pattern that
        appears on candidate rows and signals hierarchy depth, for example:
        - Decimal numbering: "1.", "1.1", "1.1.1" → depth increases with dot count
        - Enumeration styles: "一、" "（一）" "1、" "①" "1 " → shallower to deeper with increasing numbers
        - Chapter/section keywords: "Chapter X", "Part X", "第X章", "第X节"
        - Clear semantic granularities or groups of themes
        - Upper case / lower case differences
        Rank these patterns from shallowest to deepest to form a pattern → level mapping.
        Placeholder rows MUST NOT influence this scan.

        **STEP 2 — Assign a level to every candidate (rules in priority order)**
        Your task is to determine each candidate's heading level from scratch
        based on its text, context, and the patterns discovered in STEP 1.

        Rule 1 — Parent-child continuity and no level skipping:
            A heading, compared to candidates before it, may stay at the same level,
            or go ONE level deeper than its nearest valid ancestor heading.
            However, jumps such as level 1 → level 3 are **always invalid**.

        Rule 2 — Semantic headings detection (NO numbering pattern):
            A candidate WITHOUT any structural/numbering marker can still be a
            heading, but ONLY when ALL of the following hold:
            a) The text is short and title-like — no sentence-ending punctuation.
            b) In the input sequence it is IMMEDIATELY followed by a
                placeholder ``[N BODY LINES]``, or by another candidate with finer granularity.
                This is the "section bulk" signal — the row introduces a body block or a subsection group.

        Rule 3 — Body text demotion (candidate → -1):
            Demote a candidate to level = -1 when it clearly does NOT serve as a
            section title. Strongest demotion cues:
            - The text is an isolated fragment, data value, or caption-like snippet (e.g. "Table x", "Figure x", "Table/Figure").
            - The text has sentence-ending punctuation or is clearly prose.

        {rule_5}

        ***Output requirements***
        - Output MUST be a [JSON array] only.
        - Include ONLY candidate rows you judge to be headings (level >= 1).
        - NEVER emit a placeholder row. Every ``id`` field MUST be a single integer (no hyphen).
        - Each element must contain these fields in order:
            - "id": original line number (integer)
            - "level": the corrected heading level (integer from 1 to {max_depth})

        ***Format requirements***
        - Output only valid JSON — do not add markdown fences (no ```json).
        - Do not add any explanations, comments, control characters, or descriptive texts.

        text between them.

        Your ONLY task: for each group, decide whether the lines should be MERGED
        into one single heading, or kept as SEPARATE headings in a parent-child
        relationship.

        **MERGE when ALL hold:**
        1. Reading the lines in sequence produces ONE grammatically complete,
           natural-sounding title — no missing words, no awkward break.
        2. The first line alone is grammatically INCOMPLETE as a standalone title
           (e.g. ends with a possessive "'s", a preposition "of / for / and",
           a conjunction, or is otherwise a dangling fragment).
        3. No semantic gap: every subsequent line is a direct lexical extension
           of the first, not a new sub-topic.

        **KEEP SEPARATE when ANY hold:**
        - The first line is already a complete, self-contained title on its own.
        - Subsequent lines introduce a different topic or finer sub-topic.
        - Lines form a clear parent-heading → child-heading sequence.
        - **Any subsequent line begins with a numeric or ordinal prefix** such as
          `01`, `1.`, `(1)`, `①`, `一、`, `第一` — these are numbered sub-items,
          never continuation fragments of the preceding heading.

        **Generic linguistic signals that indicate MERGE:**
        - Line ends with a possessive ("Company's", "Board's") — demands a noun phrase.
        - Line ends with a preposition ("of", "for", "under", "and") — phrase is incomplete.

        You are extracting document-outline-level headings from a PDF page screenshot.

        READING ORDER:
        This page may contain one or more readable columns.
        Within each column, read from top to bottom.
        Between columns, read from {column_order}.
        Return every qualifying heading on this page in that reading order.
        Do not skip a heading just because it looks like a known section title;

        {{
        "titles": [
            {{

        ═══ MANDATORY BOOLEAN FLAGS (CRITICAL) ═══
        For EVERY extracted heading, you MUST accurately evaluate these two flags:
        1. is_in_table (boolean): Set to `true` if the text is ANYWHERE inside a table.
        2. is_in_header_footer (boolean): Set to `true` if the text is located in the top margin (header) or bottom margin (footer) of the page.

        ═══ WHAT TO EXTRACT ═══

        Only extract text that satisfies ALL three criteria:

        1. HEADING FUNCTION (primary — must be true):
        The text serves as a TITLE for the body content that follows it.
        It introduces or labels a block of subsequent paragraphs, clauses,
        or sub-sections. If you removed this text, the following body content
        would lose its topic label.

        2. STANDALONE LINE (must be true):
        The text occupies its own line, clearly separated from surrounding
        body paragraphs. It is NOT inside a table, NOT part of a list,
        and NOT embedded within a sentence.

        3. VISUAL DISTINCTION (supporting):
        The text is visually set apart from body text — larger font, bold,
        centered, extra vertical spacing, or wrapped in a distinctive
        background color block.

        "prominence": 1.0 = most prominent; 0.5 = medium; 0.1 = minor.
        Return titles in {reading_order_upper} order. Text must be EXACT verbatim.

        ═══ WHAT TO EXCLUDE (critical — read carefully) ═══

        1. TABLE CONTENT — Any text that is part of a table. If the
        text is surrounded by grid lines, borders, or cell boundaries, or if
        its neighboring content is arranged in rows and columns, it is table
        content and MUST BE EXCLUDED. This applies even when the text is bold,
        large, or spans a merged cell. Specifically exclude:
        - Column headers, row category labels, merged-cell group labels
        - Any label inside a tabular layout, regardless of visual prominence

        2. PAGE PERIPHERY — Text in margins or corners of the page:
        organization/document names repeated as running headers, page numbers,
        book/volume titles used as running headers or footers.

        3. INLINE TEXT — bullet list items, numbered clauses, or text that continues a paragraph.
        These are content items, not section headings, even if bold.

        4. CAPTIONS — Figure/table captions, footnotes.

        5. TOC ENTRIES — If the page is itself a Table of Contents or index,
        do NOT extract its listed entries. A TOC page lists other sections
        with page numbers — those entries are references, not headings.

        ═══ IMPORTANT ═══
        Many pages consist entirely of tables, numbered clauses, or appendix forms.
        These pages have NO qualifying headings. Return {{"titles": []}} for them.
        Do NOT force-extract table labels or numbered items as headings.

        Return ONLY the JSON object, no markdown fences.

You are constructing a fine-grained document hierarchy for ONE already-bounded
PDF segment. The input rows are NOT raw body text. They are clean title
candidates observed directly from page screenshots by a VLM, then trimmed to
the interior of one coarse TOC leaf.

Your task:
- Assign a relative hierarchy level to each real section/table/form heading.
- Level 1 means top-level under the confirmed coarse parent, level 2 is its
  child, etc.
- Preserve all legitimate sibling headings. Consecutive same-level headings are
  normal and MUST NOT be demoted just because no body text appears between rows.
- Use page order as reading order. The "prominence" value is visual strength,
  but numbering and structural pattern are more important.

{coarse_section}

Input rows:
'''

Rules:
1. Trust structural numbering patterns first:
   - "1", "2", "3" style headings at the same granularity are siblings.
   - "3.1" is a child of "3"; "3.2.1" is a child of "3.2".
   - "附录 A/B/C" are top-level siblings inside the segment unless the parent
     context says otherwise.
   - "表/附表" entries under an appendix are usually children of that appendix.
2. Do not skip levels. A child can be at most one level deeper than its nearest
   valid parent.
3. Filter only obvious noise:
   - duplicate/repeated variants of the same heading on adjacent rows;
   - TOC/index headings such as "Contents", "目录", "目次";
   - front matter such as "前言" when it is outside the segment's body outline.
4. When two rows are near-duplicates, keep the clearer/more complete one and
   omit the duplicate from output.
5. Do not invent headings. Only return ids that exist in the input.

Output requirements:
- Output ONLY a valid JSON array. No markdown fences, no explanations.
- Include each retained heading as:
  {{"id": <integer>, "level": <integer from 1 to {max_depth}>}}
- Omitted ids are treated as filtered noise.

        [Candidate Region Content]
        The following table shows candidate lines with their id (0-indexed) and content:
        {texts}

        [Judgment Rules]
        Please analyze the above content and find the actual start and end line ids of the table of contents region:

        1. **TOC Line Characteristics**:
        - Starts with "Table of Contents", "Contents", "目录", "目次", etc.
        - Usually contains chapter numbers or serial numbers (e.g., "1.", "Chapter 1", "一、", "第一章", etc.)
        - Contains heading text, usually with page numbers at the end
        - Format is relatively uniform and neat, with ellipsis "..." possible in the middle of line text
        - TOC region should include the line containing keywords like "Table of Contents", "Contents", "目录" if they exist

        [Output Format]
        Output in JSON format:
        {{
            "toc_start": number,  // TOC start id (must be in range {start_idx} to {end_idx})
            "toc_end": number,    // TOC end id (must be in range {start_idx} to {end_idx})
            "confidence": "high" | "medium" | "low"  // Confidence level
        }}

        If no TOC region matching the above characteristics exists in the input content, output:
        {{
            "toc_start": null,
            "toc_end": null,
            "confidence": "low"
        }}

        Output JSON only, do not output anything else
