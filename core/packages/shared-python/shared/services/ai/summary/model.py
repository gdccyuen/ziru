"""Unified summary engine — shared output contracts.

This module defines the two intentional summary output shapes used across both
ingestion tracks (see audit §4.1):

- ``BodySummary`` (Contract A) — text chunks and per-page page tags. Carries
  ``summary`` + ``entities``. It has **no title**: the node/page already owns
  its section title via the hierarchy (``path`` / ``section_title``), and the
  summary layer must never regenerate it.
- ``AssetSummary`` (Contract B) — tables, images, figures, charts. Carries the
  asset's *own* ``title`` (caption/label), a ``summary``, and ``entities``.
  For statistical content the summary naturally incorporates key numbers.
